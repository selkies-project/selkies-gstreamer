# Components

## Component Structure

Selkies-GStreamer is composed of various mandatory and optional components.

**Refer to [Getting Started](start.md) on how you can get on board.**

Use the following commands to retrieve the latest `SELKIES_VERSION` release, the current Ubuntu `DISTRIB_RELEASE`, and the current architecture `ARCH` in the next sections:

```bash
export SELKIES_VERSION="$(curl -fsSL "https://api.github.com/repos/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name' | sed 's/[^0-9\.\-]*//g')"
export DISTRIB_RELEASE="$(grep '^VERSION_ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '\"')"
export ARCH="$(dpkg --print-architecture)"
```

When instructed to install [binfmt](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt), use the following command with Docker/Podman:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt:latest --install all
```

### Mandatory Components

There are currently three mandatory components in Selkies-GStreamer.

All mandatory components are available for download from the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` Build Artifacts (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch. Build Artifacts can also be downloaded using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) command [`gh run download`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_run_download).

#### Conda Toolchain

Our [reference portable distribution toolchain](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/conda) is compiled with the distribution-neutral [Conda](https://conda-forge.org) build toolchain, distributing all three mandatory components as well as portable versions of most dependencies in a tarball.

Pre-built `x86_64` portable distributions for **any Linux distribution with `glibc â‰¥ 2.17`** (CentOS 7 or newer) are available with the name **`selkies-gstreamer-portable-v${SELKIES_VERSION}_amd64.tar.gz`** for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

**Instructions from [Quick Start](start.md#quick-start) still apply below.**

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` **`conda_linux-amd64`** Build Artifact (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch.

Alternatively, copy the pre-built `x86_64` portable distribution build from the container image (use your own directory other than `/opt`, change `main` with `latest` for the latest stable release):

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name conda ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/conda:main
docker cp conda:/opt/selkies-gstreamer-conda.tar.gz /tmp/selkies-gstreamer-conda.tar.gz
docker rm conda
cd ~ && tar -xzf /tmp/selkies-gstreamer-conda.tar.gz && rm -f /tmp/selkies-gstreamer-conda.tar.gz
# Run Selkies-GStreamer portable distribution
/opt/selkies-gstreamer/selkies-gstreamer-run --addr=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --enable_https=false --https_cert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem --https_key=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key --basic_auth_user=user --basic_auth_password=mypasswd --encoder=x264enc --enable_resize=false
```

Otherwise (for different system architectures), you can build your own portable distribution (currently tested with `aarch64` and `ppc64le`).

#### Python Application

The term `host` or `server` refers to the [Python Components](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/src/selkies_gstreamer) across this documentation.

The [Python Components](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/src/selkies_gstreamer) are responsible for the host server backend, capturing and encoding the host screen and audio, receiving input signals and communicating other data (including the clipboard) between the client and the host, and establishing the WebRTC (with RTP underneath) connection to the client.

Host screen video and audio are transported using the WebRTC `MediaStream` interface, and other data are transported using the WebRTC `DataChannel` interface.

The architecture-independent components are available with the name **`selkies_gstreamer-${SELKIES_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl`** for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

**Instructions from [Advanced Install](start.md#advanced-install) still apply below.**

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` **`py-build_linux-amd64`** Build Artifact (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch.

Alternatively, copy the Python Wheel file from the build container image (DO NOT change the platform in non-`x86_64` architectures, install [binfmt](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt) instead, and change `main` with `latest` for the latest stable release):

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name selkies-py ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/py-build:main
docker cp selkies-py:/opt/pypi/dist/selkies_gstreamer-0.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl /tmp/selkies_gstreamer-0.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl
docker rm selkies-py
sudo PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 pip3 install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall /tmp/selkies_gstreamer-0.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl
rm -f /tmp/selkies_gstreamer-0.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl
# Run Selkies-GStreamer Python executable after all components are installed
selkies-gstreamer --addr=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --enable_https=false --https_cert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem --https_key=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key --basic_auth_user=user --basic_auth_password=mypasswd --encoder=x264enc --enable_resize=false
```

One other alternative way to install the Python application components from the most recent unreleased commit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer.git
cd selkies-gstreamer
sudo PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 pip3 install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall .
# Run Selkies-GStreamer Python executable after all components are installed
selkies-gstreamer --addr=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --enable_https=false --https_cert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem --https_key=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key --basic_auth_user=user --basic_auth_password=mypasswd --encoder=x264enc --enable_resize=false
```

#### Web Application

The term `client` refers to the [Web Components](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/gst-web) across this documentation.

The [Web Components](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/gst-web) are responsible the web browser interface that you see when you use Selkies-GStreamer.

They receive and display the received screen and audio within the web browser, detect input signal and other data (including the clipboard) from the user, then send them to the host server backend.

They also handle remote cursors with the Pointer Lock API that allows you to correctly control interactive applications and games, and also modify the SDP (responsible for negotiating the stream between the host and the client) so that hidden web browser features can be utilized.

WebRTC enables web browser clients to decode the stream using GPU hardware acceleration, as well as GPU-accelerated stream encoding from the host.

The architecture-independent components are available with the name **`selkies-gstreamer-web_v${SELKIES_VERSION}.tar.gz`** for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

**Instructions from [Advanced Install](start.md#advanced-install) still apply below.**

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` **`gst-web_linux-amd64`** Build Artifact (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch.

Alternatively, install the web interface components to the container image (DO NOT change the platform in non-`x86_64` architectures, install [binfmt](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt) instead, and change `main` with `latest` for the latest stable release):

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name gst-web ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/gst-web:main
sudo docker cp gst-web:/usr/share/nginx/html /opt/gst-web
docker rm gst-web
```

One other alternative way to install the web interface components from the most recent unreleased commit (replace `INSTALL_DIR=/opt/gst-web` with your own directory):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer.git
cd selkies-gstreamer/addons/gst-web
sudo INSTALL_DIR=/opt/gst-web ./install.sh
```

#### GStreamer

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) "is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing." GStreamer is likely inside your smart TV, car infotainment system, or the digital street signage or surveillance camera near you, as well as many media players and video editing software.

GStreamer is responsible for the actual heavy lifting of Selkies-GStreamer, starting from capturing and encoding the host screen and audio to transporting the stream and other data between the host and the client web browser using WebRTC. GStreamer can be installed from your Linux distribution (but the required newest version may not be available), be [built for your distribution](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/gstreamer), or be compiled and distributed in portable form with [Conda](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/conda).

Check [GStreamer Components](#gstreamer-components) for more details.

Pre-built `x86_64` GStreamer components for Ubuntu are available with the name (fill in the OS version `DISTRIB_RELEASE` such as `24.04`, `22.04`) **`gstreamer-selkies_gpl_v${SELKIES_VERSION}_ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}_amd64.tar.gz`** for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` **`gstreamer-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}_linux-amd64`** Build Artifact (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch.

**Instructions from [Advanced Install](start.md#advanced-install) still apply below.**

Alternatively, copy the pre-built `x86_64` GStreamer build from the container image and move it to `/opt/gstreamer` or your directory of choice (change `main` with `latest` for the latest stable release):

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name gstreamer ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/gstreamer:main-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}
sudo docker cp gstreamer:/opt/gstreamer /opt/gstreamer
docker rm gstreamer
# Initialize the pre-built GStreamer environment for Selkies-GStreamer to use
. /opt/gstreamer/gst-env
```

Otherwise (for different operating system distributions or system architectures), you can build your own GStreamer version as long as it is the latest possible stable version.

### Optional Components

These components are not required for Selkies-GStreamer, but may be required in specific cases of deployments or preferences. These sections are recommended to be nonetheless, read carefully.

#### Joystick Interposer

The [Joystick Interposer](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/js-interposer) is a special library that allows the usage of joysticks or gamepads inside unprivileged containers (most of the occasions with shared Kubernetes clusters or HPC clusters), where host kernel devices required for creating a joystick interface are not available. It uses a `LD_PRELOAD` hack to intercept `uinput` input commands from joysticks or gamepads into Selkies-GStreamer (much like how [VirtualGL](https://github.com/VirtualGL/virtualgl) intercepts OpenGL commands).

Pre-built `x86_64` and `aarch64` joystick interposer components for Ubuntu are available with the name (fill in the OS version `DISTRIB_RELEASE` such as `24.04`, `22.04`, Ubuntu-style architecture `ARCH` such as `amd64` and `arm64`) **`selkies-js-interposer_v${SELKIES_VERSION}_ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}_${ARCH}.tar.gz`** or **`selkies-js-interposer_v${SELKIES_VERSION}_ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}_${ARCH}.deb`** for download in the [Releases](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/releases) for the latest stable version.

**Instructions from [Advanced Install](start.md#advanced-install) still apply below.**

For the most recent unreleased commit, download from the [GitHub Actions Workflow Runs](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/actions) `Build & publish all images` **`js-interposer-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}-tar.gz_linux-${ARCH}`** or **`js-interposer-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}-deb_linux-${ARCH}`** Build Artifact (under `Artifacts (Produced during runtime)`) for each commit from the `main` branch.

Alternatively, copy and install the pre-built Joystick Interposer build (change `--platform=` to `linux/arm64` for `aarch64`, and change `main` with `latest` and `0.0.0` to the release version for the latest stable release):

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name js-interposer ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/js-interposer:main-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}
docker cp js-interposer:/opt/selkies-js-interposer_0.0.0.deb /tmp/selkies-js-interposer.deb
docker rm js-interposer
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends --allow-downgrades -y /tmp/selkies-js-interposer.deb
rm -f /tmp/selkies-js-interposer.deb
```

To retrieve the `.tar.gz` tarball instead of the `.deb` installer:

```bash
docker create --platform="linux/amd64" --name js-interposer ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/js-interposer:main-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}
docker cp js-interposer:/opt/selkies-js-interposer_0.0.0.tar.gz /tmp/selkies-js-interposer_0.0.0.tar.gz
docker rm js-interposer
```

After extracting the `.tar.gz` tarball, move the `.so` library files to the library path (such as `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu`) of your Linux distribution.

The following paths are required to exist for the Joystick Interposer to pass the joystick/gamepad input to various applications:

```bash
sudo mkdir -pm1777 /dev/input
sudo touch /dev/input/js0 /dev/input/js1 /dev/input/js2 /dev/input/js3
sudo touch /dev/input/event1000 /dev/input/event1001 /dev/input/event1002 /dev/input/event1003
sudo chmod 777 /dev/input/js* /dev/input/event*
```

The following environment variables are required to be set in the environment each application is being run in to receive the joystick/gamepad input.

```bash
export SELKIES_INTERPOSER='/usr/$LIB/selkies_joystick_interposer.so'
export LD_PRELOAD="${SELKIES_INTERPOSER}${LD_PRELOAD:+:${LD_PRELOAD}}"
```

You can replace `/usr/$LIB/selkies_joystick_interposer.so` with any non-root path of your choice if using the `.tar.gz` tarball.

Check the [Joystick Interposer README.md](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/js-interposer/README.md) documentation for usage instruction and compiling information on other platforms.

#### Example Container

The [Example Container](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/example) is the reference minimal-functionality container developers can base upon, or test Selkies-GStreamer quickly. The bare minimum Xfce4 desktop environment is installed together with Firefox, as well as an embedded TURN server inside the container for quick WebRTC firewall traversal.

Read the [Development](development.md) section for customizing this container for your own usage.

Run the DockerÂ®/Podman container built from the [`Example Dockerfile`](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/example/Dockerfile), then connect to port **8080** of your DockerÂ®/Podman host to access the web interface (Username: **`ubuntu`**, Password: **`mypasswd`**, **change `DISTRIB_RELEASE` to `24.04`, `22.04`, or `20.04`, and replace `main` to `latest` for the latest stable release**):

```bash
docker run --name selkies -it -d --rm -e SELKIES_TURN_PROTOCOL=udp -e SELKIES_TURN_PORT=3478 -e TURN_MIN_PORT=65534 -e TURN_MAX_PORT=65535 -p 8080:8080 -p 3478:3478 -p 3478:3478/udp -p 65534-65535:65534-65535 -p 65534-65535:65534-65535/udp ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/gst-py-example:main-ubuntu${DISTRIB_RELEASE}
```

Port 3478 and 65534-65535 (change the ports accordingly) are the ports for the internal TURN server needed to route WebRTC through restrictive networks. When deploying multiple containers, these ports must be changed (together with the environment variables `TURN_MIN_PORT`/`TURN_MAX_PORT` with at least two ports in the range plus the environment variable`SELKIES_TURN_PORT`) and cannot be used by any other host process or container.

If UDP cannot be used, at the cost of higher latency and lower performance, omit the ports containing `/udp` and use the environment variable `-e SELKIES_TURN_PROTOCOL=tcp`.

All these ports must be exposed to the internet if you need access over the internet. If you need use TURN within a local network, add `-e SELKIES_TURN_HOST={YOUR_INTERNAL_IP}` with `{YOUR_INTERNAL_IP}` to the internal hostname or IP of the local network. IPv6 addresses must be enclosed with square brackets such as `[::1]`.

Otherwise, to enable host networking, add `--network=host` to the DockerÂ® command to enable host networking and work around this requirement if your server is not behind a firewall. Note that running multiple desktop containers in one host under this configuration may be problematic and is not recommended. You must also pass new environment variables such as `-e DISPLAY=:22`, `-e NGINX_PORT=8082`, `-e SELKIES_PORT=8083`, and `-e SELKIES_METRICS_HTTP_PORT=9083` into the container, all not overlapping with any other X11 server or container in the same host. Access the container using the specified `NGINX_PORT`.

If you are behind a reverse proxy or can only expose one HTTP port, you will need to use an external STUN/TURN server capable of `srflx` or `relay` type ICE connections if you use this in a container WITHOUT host networking.

**Follow the instructions from [coTURN](#coturn) and [WebRTC and Firewall Issues](firewall.md) in order to make the container work using an external TURN server.**

#### coTURN

> Check the [WebRTC and Firewall Issues: coTURN](firewall.md#coturn) section for installing and running coTURN on self-hosted standalone machines, cloud instances, or virtual machines.
>
> [Pion TURN](https://github.com/pion/turn)'s `turn-server-simple` executable or [eturnal](https://eturnal.net) are recommended alternative TURN server implementations that support Windows as well as Linux or MacOS. [STUNner](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner) is a Kubernetes native STUN and TURN deployment if Helm is possible to be used.

The [coTURN Container](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/coturn) is a reference container which provides the [coTURN](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) TURN server. Other than options including `-e TURN_SHARED_SECRET=`, `-e TURN_REALM=`, `-e TURN_PORT=`, `-e TURN_MIN_PORT=` (at least `49152`), and `-e TURN_MAX_PORT=` (at most `65535`), add more command-line options in `-e TURN_EXTRA_ARGS=`.

Run the DockerÂ®/Podman container built from the [`coTURN Dockerfile`](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/coturn/Dockerfile) (**replace `main` to `latest` for the latest stable release**):

```bash
docker run --name coturn -it -d --rm -e TURN_SHARED_SECRET=n0TaRealCoTURNAuthSecretThatIsSixtyFourLengthsLongPlaceholdPlace -e TURN_REALM=example.com -e TURN_PORT=3478 -e TURN_MIN_PORT=65500 -e TURN_MAX_PORT=65535 -p 3478:3478 -p 3478:3478/udp -p 65500-65535:65500-65535 -p 65500-65535:65500-65535/udp ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/coturn:main
```

**The relay ports and the listening port must all be open to the internet.**

If the TURN relay port range is wide, it may take a very long time for the containers to start up. Simply using `--network=host` instead of specifying `-p 65500-65535:65500-65535` and `-p 65500-65535:65500-65535/udp` can also be plausible.

Modify the relay ports `-p 65500-65535:65500-65535` and `-p 65500-65535:65500-65535/udp` combined with `-e TURN_MIN_PORT=65500 -e TURN_MAX_PORT=65535` as appropriate (at least two relay ports are required per connection).

In addition, use the option `-e TURN_EXTRA_ARGS="--no-udp-relay"` if you cannot open the UDP `min-port=` to `max-port=` port ranges, or `-e TURN_EXTRA_ARGS="--no-tcp-relay"` if you cannot open the TCP `min-port=` to `max-port=` port ranges. Note that the `--no-udp-relay` option may not be supported with web browsers and may lead to the TURN server not working.

Consult the [WebRTC and Firewall Issues: TURN Server Authentication Methods](firewall.md#turn-server-authentication-methods) and [TURN-REST](#turn-rest) sections for the difference between static auth secret/TURN REST API authentication and traditional long-term credential authentication.

#### TURN-REST

**The below is an advanced concept likely required for multi-user environments.**

A TURN server is required with WebRTC when both the host and the client are under Symmetric NAT or are each under Port Restricted Cone NAT and Symmetric NAT.

In easier words, if both the host and client are behind restrictive firewalls, the web interface and signaling connection (delivered using HTTP(S) and WebSocket) are delivered and established, but the video and audio stream (delivered using WebRTC) does not establish. In this case, the TURN server relays the WebRTC stream so that the host and client can send the video and audio stream, as well as other data.

![TURN-REST.svg](assets/TURN-REST.svg)

The recommended multi-user TURN server authentication mechanism is the [time-limited short-term credential/TURN REST API mechanism](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00), where there is a single [shared secret](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/master/README.turnserver) that is never exposed externally (only the TURN-REST Container and the coTURN TURN server know), but instead authenticates WebRTC clients (which are Selkies-GStreamer hosts and clients) based on generated credentials which are valid for only a short time (typically 24 hours).

The [TURN-REST Container](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/turn-rest) is an easy way to distribute short-term TURN server authentication credentials and the information of the TURN server based on the REST API to many Selkies-GStreamer host instances, particularly when behind a local area network (LAN), which may or may not have restricted firewalls.

Using the `selkies-gstreamer --turn_rest_uri=` option or `SELKIES_TURN_REST_URI` environment variable, the Selkies-GStreamer host periodically queries a URI such as `https://turn-rest.myinfrastructure.io/myturnrest` or `http://192.168.0.10/myturnrest`.

This URI is ideally behind a local area network (LAN) inaccessible from the outside and only accessible to the Python hosts inside the LAN, or alternatively behind authentication using any web server or reverse proxy, if accessible from the outside. This information is periodically sent to the web client (that is also preferably behind authentication with HTTP Basic Authentication or a web server/reverse proxy) through HTTP(S), thus the TURN server information and credentials being propagated to both the Python host and the web client without exposing the TURN server information outside.

Because the time-limited TURN credentials automatically expire after some time, they are not useful even if they are leaked outside, as long as the pathway to the air-gapped or authenticated TURN-REST Container REST HTTP endpoint is not exposed plainly to the internet. [app.py](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/turn-rest/app.py) may also be hosted standalone without a container using the same startup command in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/turn-rest/Dockerfile).

Other authentication methods such as TURN-REST over various types of REST API authentication (but adding support for TURN-REST behind Basic Authentication is trivial, so reach out with some funding) or TURN oAuth authentication are not supported as of now, and likely requires funding.

The TURN-REST Container (or similarly, Kubernetes Pod) should be triggered with the DockerÂ®/Podman options `-e TURN_SHARED_SECRET=`, `-e TURN_HOST=`, `-e TURN_PORT=`, `-e TURN_PROTOCOL=`, `-e TURN_TLS=`, `-e STUN_HOST=`, `-e STUN_PORT=`, where the options are dependent on the TURN server configuration of [coTURN](#coturn) or other TURN server implementations.

Run the DockerÂ®/Podman container built from the [`TURN-REST Dockerfile`](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/turn-rest/Dockerfile) (replace `main` to `latest` for the latest stable release**):

```bash
docker run --name turn-rest -it -d --rm -e TURN_SHARED_SECRET=n0TaRealCoTURNAuthSecretThatIsSixtyFourLengthsLongPlaceholdPlace -e TURN_HOST=turn.myinfrastructure.io -e TURN_PORT=3478 -e TURN_PROTOCOL=udp -e TURN_TLS=false -p 8008:8008 ghcr.io/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/turn-rest:main
```

From Selkies-GStreamer, it is sufficient to use the `selkies-gstreamer --turn_rest_uri=` option or `export SELKIES_TURN_REST_URI=` environment variable, pointing to the HTTP(S) URI to the TURN REST API server.

Consult the [WebRTC and Firewall Issues: TURN Server Authentication Methods](firewall.md#turn-server-authentication-methods) section for more information on TURN authentication methods.

#### coTURN-Web

The [coTURN-Web Container](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/coturn-web) is a legacy component meant to provide similar capabilities to the [TURN-REST Container](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/addons/turn-rest) for the Google Kubernetes Engine, mostly old remnants from the Google era. This component may be phased out as well as the [`infra/gce`](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/infra/gce) and [`infra/gke`](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies-gstreamer/tree/main/infra/gke) components and `cloudbuild.yml` configurations in favor of platform-agnostic Kubernetes configurations. Contributions are welcome.

## GStreamer Components

**Read [GStreamer Development Guide](development.md#gstreamer-development-guide) together with this part.**

Below are GStreamer components that are implemented and therefore used with Selkies-GStreamer. Some include environment variables or command-line options which may be used select one type of component, and others are chosen automatically based on the operating system or configuration. This section is to be continuously updated.

### Encoders

This table specifies the currently implemented video encoders and their corresponding codecs, which may be set using the environment variable `SELKIES_ENCODER` or the command-line option `--encoder=`.

**Encoders marked as "Recommended": Tested on Chromium where the encoder adds no perceptible delay or frame drops from the host encoder even with a high (> 16 Mbps) bitrate with an actively moving screen.** Note that broadband internet through 5 GHz Wi-Fi or wired ethernet are strongly recommended.

**As Selkies-GStreamer uses new GStreamer components from the latest stable GStreamer versions, GStreamer â‰¥ 1.22 is the current strict requirement. No support will be provided for older versions, but you can [build your own latest GStreamer version](#gstreamer) in older distributions or use the [portable Conda distribution](#conda-toolchain).**
